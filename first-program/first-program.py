# My First Python Program

# print() is a built-in Python function used to output data to the screen.

# Example 1: Basic hello world
print("Hello, world!")  # Anyone can understand this line

# Example 2: Printing multiple lines
print("Hello")
print("My name is Abdul Basit")
print("I am 21 years old")

# Example 3: Printing multiple strings in a single line
print("Hello", "my name is Abdul Basit", "I am 21 years old")

# Example 4: Printing numbers and expressions
print(21)               # This will output the number 21
print(50 + 23)          # This will output the result of the expression: 73
