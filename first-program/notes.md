# üêç First Python Program

This was my first step into Python programming using the `print()` function.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

- `print()` is used to **display output**.
- Python statements are simple and readable almost like English!
- You can use `print()` to show:
  - Plain text (strings)
  - Numbers
  - Results of math expressions

## üí° Python Character Set

Python supports a wide range of characters:

- **Letters**: A‚ÄìZ, a‚Äìz
- **Digits**: 0‚Äì9
- **Special symbols**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, etc.
- **Whitespace**: space, tab, newline
- **Other characters**: Python supports ASCII and Unicode (like emojis, other scripts)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è But **keywords and identifiers** must still follow standard English/ASCII rules, you can't use Urdu/Hindi for variable names unless encoded properly.

## üìå Examples

```python
print("Hello, world!")                            # Basic string output
print("My name is Abdul Basit", "Age: 21")        # Multiple values
print(21)                                         # Integer
print(50 + 23)                                    # Expression
