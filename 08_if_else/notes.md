# If-Else in Python

The `if-else` statement is used to make decisions in code.  
It checks conditions and executes different code depending on whether the condition is **True** or **False**.cd
### Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # code runs if condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # code runs if first condition is false, but this is true
else:
    # code runs if none of the above conditions are true
