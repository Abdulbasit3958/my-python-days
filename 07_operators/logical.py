# " OR" in this it works like if there is 2 condition one is true and one is false so it show is the statement true it will only show false once both the satetment is false 

print(2 > 3 or 2 > 1)

# "and " in this if both the condition is true then it wil show it is true 

print(3 > 2 or 2 > 1)

# "not "in this it show the the opposte statement if the condition is true it will show false 

print(not 2 > 3)
