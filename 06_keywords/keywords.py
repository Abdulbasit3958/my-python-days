# Keywords and checking substrings in Python

# Just like in English we have words like apple, banana etc.
# In Python, some words like input or print are predefined keywords.
# We cannot assign them as variable names.

# Example: checking if something exists in a string

name = "Abdul Basit"

print("Abdul" in name)   # returns True
print("mansab" in name)  # returns False
