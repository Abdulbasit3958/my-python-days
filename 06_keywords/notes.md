# 📘 Keywords and Substring Check

## 1. Keywords in Python
- In English we have words like **apple, banana**.  
- In Python we have reserved words (keywords) like **print, input, if, else**.  
- These are predefined and **cannot** be used as variable names.

Example ❌:
```python
print = "hello"   # wrong, because print is a keyword
