🐍 My Python Days – Beginner Journey in Daily Doses
Hey! This repo is my personal space where I drop small, beginner-friendly Python chunks every day — just like taking baby steps into coding.
I'm not doing this as a full-on course, just learning and sharing little by little.

Each folder = one main topic
Each file = simple code + easy notes

🔖 What You’ll Find Here:
✨ Super simple examples with comments

📄 Notes that explain each topic in plain language

📁 Clean folder structure — not too technical, just easy to follow

💡 Why I’m Doing This:
To stay consistent by doing something small every day

To help anyone who’s just starting out and feels lost

To track my growth and make Python feel less scary
