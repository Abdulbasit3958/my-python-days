# My Python Days 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning journey!

This repo is where I document everything I'm learning in Python — one topic at a time.  
Each folder contains:
- Python code examples (`.py` files)
- Simple explanation notes (`notes.md`)

I'm keeping it public so I can track progress, reflect later, and maybe help someone else too!
